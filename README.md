## Installation Guide

To run this app locally, you'll need both the **frontend** and **backend** running.

**Install Prerequisites**
Before installing/running the backend, please make sure you have the following installed:

‚òï Java Development Kit (JDK)

üì¶ Apache Maven

üê¨ MySQL Database

### üß© Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

‚û°Ô∏è Backend Repo: [pulseboard-backend](https://github.com/ronaldkwan93/spring-employee-track)

**1. Clone the backend repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronaldkwan93/spring-employee-track.git
cd spring-employee-track
```

**2. Configure MySQL:**

- Log in to MySQL

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

- Create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

**3. Configure the application properties:**

- Navigate to the src/main/resources directory

- Create an **application.properties** file and add the following configuration:

```properties
spring.application.name=employeeTracker
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```

**4. Install Dependencies:**

```sh
mvn clean install
```

**5. Run the application:**

- Use the following command to run the application:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### ‚öõÔ∏è Frontend Setup (React)

#### 1. Clone frontend repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronaldkwan93/client-employee-tracker.git
cd client-employee-tracker
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Vite should prompt you to connect to localhost: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

## Challenges

- Handling case-insensitive search and filtering effectively

- Synchronizing frontend validation (FormData API + Zod) with backend constraints

- Ensuring smooth data flow between frontend and backend with DTOs and API contracts

- Migrating and offloading business logic from frontend to backend for a better client experience

- Avoided prop drilling by implementing global state management using React's `useContext` and a custom provider

## Areas for Growth

- Add user authentication and role-based access (e.g. manager vs HR)

- Introduce pagination and lazy loading for large datasets

- Enable profile picture uploads or avatars per employee
